# OpenGVS

This is for any android device, but actually meant for the Joying units.

micro apk (17Kb) which does nothing else than call the open Google Search in "googlevoicesearch" mode. 
A number of luanchers only recognise the main launcher intent.category. This micro apk will start Google Search using the "com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox.VoiceSearchActivity" intent.category.

It can also be used from XFytTweaker for a primary/secondary/tertiary button action or from FytHWOnekey to replace one of the standard system app calls.
For the rest it is a useless app :).
